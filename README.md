# ImageUpscaling_Python
The goal is to increase the resolution (number of pixels) in the image while at the same time adding appropriate high frequency information.
Convolution Neural Network (CNN) is used with a custom dataset. Model is trained in Python with Tensorflow & Keras in ‘.H5’ format and additional Front-end is integrated in Flask for this particular project.

# ToDo
1. Trained ‘.H5’ model is already available in the ‘model’ folder. In case a custom model or custom dataset is needed for training then main.py is the file to refer. 
2. Link to the dataset we prepared for this model : 
3. Front is available in HTML, CSS & JavaScript with all the required assets. This can be integrated using Flask which we preferred. If React is a requirement for the project then the model should be converted in ‘.json’ format and front-end accordingly. Therefore, simple HTML files are attached which can be reviewed in the browser.
